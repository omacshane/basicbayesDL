Basic Bayesian Deep Learning

These scripts present a basic implemention of a Bayesian Convolutional Deep Network in Keras based upon
"Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning" (2015)
by Yarin Gal and Zoubin Ghahramani

The code is based on this tutorial on CNNs in Keras:
https://cambridgespark.com/content/tutorials/convolutional-neural-networks-with-keras/index.html

as well as Yarin Gal's code https://github.com/yaringal/DropoutUncertaintyExps/blob/master/bostonHousing/net/net/net.py .

These scripts cn be used as a starting point for implement deep models using dropout Byesian
approximation
